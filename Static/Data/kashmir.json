    "text": "The Kashmir conflict is a territorial dispute primarily between India and Pakistan, with China also involved in parts of the region. The conflict began in 1947, following the partition of British India, and has led to several wars and ongoing military skirmishes. The region of Kashmir is divided into areas administered by India, Pakistan, and China, with each country claiming the entire territory. The dispute has deep historical roots, involving issues of national identity, religious affiliation, and strategic interests. Despite numerous attempts at negotiation and intervention by international bodies, a lasting resolution remains elusive, contributing to regional instability.",
